# Intellij Save Actions Plugin

[![Jetbrains Plugin](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/v/7642-save-actions.svg)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions)
[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dubreuia/intellij-plugin-save-actions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dubreuia/intellij-plugin-save-actions)

Supports configurable, Eclipse like, save actions, including "optimize imports", "reformat code", "rearrange code", "compile file" and some quick fixes like "add / remove 'this' qualifier", etc. The plugin executes the configured actions when the file is synchronised (or saved) on disk.

Using the save actions plugin makes your code cleaner and more uniform across your code base by enforcing your code style and code rules every time you save. The settings file (see [files location](#files-location)) can be shared in your development team so that every developer has the same configuration.

The code style applied by the save actions plugin is the one configured your settings at "File > Settings > Editor > Code Style". For some languages, custom formatter may also be triggered by the save actions plugin. For example for Dart developers, enable "Use the dartfmt tool when formatting the whole file" option in "File > Settings > Editor > Code Style > Dart > Dartfmt".

## Features

- Optimize imports
- Run on file save or shortcut (or both)
- Reformat code (whole file or only changed text)
- Rearrange code (reorder methods, fields, etc.)
- Include / exclude files with regex support
- Works any file type (Java, Python, XML, etc.)
- Uses a settings file per project you can commit (see [Files location](#files-location))
- Available keymaps and actions for activation (see [Keymap and actions](#keymap-and-actions))

## Compatibility

Built with IntelliJ IDEA IC-2016.3, JDK 1.8, those are the currently supported products, and is not expected to work in other products:

- Intellij IDEA
- PyCharm
- PHPStorm
- AndroidStudio
- WebStorm
- RubyMine
- CLion

See issue [#18](https://github.com/dubreuia/intellij-plugin-save-actions/issues/18) for a beta packaging that you can try in other products.

## Installation

Install it from the plugin repository in Intellij IDEA (**recommended**):

- "File > Settings > Plugins > Browse repositories... > Search 'Save Actions' > Category 'Code tools'"

Or the plugin is available from the [Intellij IDEA Community Edition plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642) and you can also download the jar from there then add it in Intellij IDEA:

- "File > Settings > Plugins > Install plugin from disk..."

## Configuration

The configurations are located in "File > Settings > Other Settings > Save Actions".

### Activation

You can quickly toggle the plugin activation by using the "Enable Save Action" action. Use "CTRL + SHIFT + A" then search for it. It will also show if it is currently activated or not.

| Name                               | Description
| ---                                | ---
| Activate save actions on file save | Enable / disable the plugin on file save. Before saving each file, it will perform the configured actions below
| Activate save actions on shortcut  | Enable / disable the plugin on shortcut, by default "CTRL + SHIFT + S" (configured in "File > Keymaps > Main menu > Code > Save Actions")
| No action if compile errors        | Enable / disable no action if there are compile errors. Applied to each file individually

### Global

| Name                               | Description
| ---                                | ---
| Optimize imports                   | Enable / disable import organization (configured in "File > Settings > Code Style > Java > Imports")
| Reformat file                      | Enable / disable formatting (configured in "File > Settings > Code Style"). See "Reformat only changed code" for more options
| Rearrange fields and methods       | Enable / disable re-ordering of fields and methods (configured in "File > Settings > Code Style > Java > Arrangement")
| Reformat only changed code         | Enable / disable formatting for changed code only. If VCS is configured, it is used to check which lines where modified. If VCS is not configured, the code will always get reformatted

### Build

| Name                               | Description
| ---                                | ---
| Compile file                       | Enable / disable compiling of the modified file. The compiler might compile other files as well

### Configuration

| Name                               | Description
| ---                                | ---
| File path inclusions               | Add / remove file path inclusions (by default, everything included). The Java regular expressions match the whole file name from the project root. Include only Java files: `.*\.java`. 
| File path exclusions               | Add / remove file path exclusions to ignore files (overrides inclusions). The Java regular expressions match the whole file name from the project root. Exclude 'Main.java' only in root folder: `Main\.java`. Exclude file 'Foo.java' only in folder 'src': `src/Foo\.java`. Exclude all xml files in any folder: `.*/.*\.xml`
| Use external Eclipse configuration | Add external configuration file ".epf" to read settings from. This will update the current settings and use only the ".epf" file content. Use "reset" button to remove

### Java fixes

If a quick fix adds something that is removed by another quick fix, the removal wins.

## IDE support

The save-actions plugin supports Eclipse configuration `.epf` files (Java IDE only). You can specify a path to an Eclipse configuration file in the "IDE Support" section to import it. The plugin will load the content of the file in the plugin configuration, and disable the plugin configuration options (the checkbox will be grayed out). Use the "reset" button to remove the import.

You can find an example of [an Eclipse configuration `.epf` file](src/test/resources/example.epf) in the test resources.

## Keymap and actions

There are two keymaps, binded to actions, that can be configured in save-actions. The keymap are configured in "Settings > Keymap > Search 'save actions'"

- **Enable save actions (default: not binded)** will activate or deactivate the plugin by changing the configuration, also available in the action menu "CTRL + SHIFT + A"
- **Save actions (default: "CTRL + SHIFT + S")** will trigger the plugin, only if the configuration allows shortcuts

## Files location

- **idea.log**: The log file the save actions plugin writes in. It contains debug information, prefixed with `com.dubreuia.SaveActionManager`. If you are using default locations, it would be in `~/.IntelliJIdeaVERSION/system/log/idea.log`.
- **saveactions_settings.xml**: The settings file is saved by project in the `.idea` folder. That file can be committed in git thus shared in your development team. If you are using the default locations, it would be in `~/IdeaProjects/PROJECT_NAME/.idea/saveactions_settings.xml`

### Development environment

The plugin is built with gradle, but you don't need to install it, you can use the gradle wrapper located at `./gradlew`. You can also build with the Intellij gradle plugin (check out the [prerequisites](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/build_system/prerequisites.html)).

Start idea and import the `build.gradle` file with "File > Open". Then in the "Import Project from Gradle" window, make sure you check "Use gradle 'wrapper' task configuration" before clicking "Finish". Now generate Intellij folders:

```bash
# Initialize idea folders
./gradlew cleanIdea idea
```

Intellij should refresh and the project is now configured as a gradle project. You can find Intellij gradle tasks in "Gradle > Gradle projects > intellij-plugin-save-actions > Tasks > intellij". To run the plugin, use the `runIde` task:

```bash
# Run the plugin (starts new idea)
./gradlew runIde
```

### Code style

The code style is located in `config/code-style.xml`, you can import it by doing "File > Settings > Editor > Code Style > Scheme > (wheel) > Import scheme > Intellij IDEA code style XML". General style should resemble existing code.

### Sending a pull request

To contribute:

- Submit a PR without modifying the META-INF/plugin.xml file (no version change)

Then the maintainer will:

- Review the change, update the version, merge to master
- Build the plugin with Intellij IDEA and test it (see compatibility section)
- Create a new release in https://github.com/dubreuia/intellij-plugin-save-actions/releases
- Upload the plugin to [JetBrains Plugins Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/)
